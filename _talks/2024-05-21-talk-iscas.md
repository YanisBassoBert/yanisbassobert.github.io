Presentation of my work on incremental learning with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), focusing on good practices for:

1. Designing fully binary architectures compatible with experience replay strategies.
2. Implementing training procedures to address convergence challenges specific to BNNs.
3. Adapting the feature extractor update strategy based on the size of the memory buffer.
