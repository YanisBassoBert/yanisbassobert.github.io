🎓 I’m an engineer and freshly graduated PhD in embedded AI and signal processing. My work focuses on designing lightweight, incremental learning algorithms for edge devices, enabling frugal, always-on intelligence.

🌿 I’m passionate about applying machine learning to real-world environmental challenges, from bioacoustics to glaciology and snow science, bridging low-power AI research environmental monitoring.

🌍 My goal: develop AI systems that are both efficient and sustainable, connecting scientific innovation with field-based applications that support conservation, monitoring, and environmental awareness.

🏔️ Outside of research, mountaineering is my second way of exploring the world — through trail running, ski touring, and climbing. I also stay curious and expressive through creative projects in music, visual design, and short films. 

📚 This site is where I share my scientific work and personal projects — from neural networks to bivouacs, from signal processing to sketches.
