🎓 I'm an  engineerand freshly graduated PhD specialized in embedded AI and signal processing, with a focus on deep learning for constrained systems.

🧠 My expertise lies in developing lightweight, incremental learning algorithms for edge devices, combining frugal inference and training strategies with disruptive hardware architectures.

🌿 I'm passionate about applying machine learning to ecological challenges — especially in environmental monitoring through bioacoustics, as well as in glaciology and snow science 🧊.

🔬 I’m driven by projects that bridge scientific research with real-world applications, combining rigor, creativity, and environmental responsibility.

 🏔️ Outside of work, I spend most of my time in the mountains ! Alpine climbing, long-distance trail running, and ski touring are my favorite ways to explore and connect with the natural world.

 🎨 I also enjoy creating: playing guitar, sketching, designing logos, and filming short videos. These artistic side projects are ways for me to slow down, observe, and share perspectives.

 📚 This site is a place where I’ll share both my scientific work and personal projects : from research in AI to reflections from the summits, and sketches from my notebook.
