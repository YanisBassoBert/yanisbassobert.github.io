To celebrate the end of my PhD and reset after an intense but rewarding defense, I set out on a solo trail run from my home to my grandparents’ house, crossing the entire Chartreuse massif along the way.  

It was my first time running more than 30 km and I went all in: 72 kilometers, 3600 meters of elevation gain, one mountain range… and a big breath of freedom.
