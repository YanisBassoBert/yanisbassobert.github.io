First 5.1 couloir: a real milestone. I tackled it with a crew of sharp, experienced skiers from Innsbruck. The initial goal was to summit the Agneaux, but dense clouds forced us to turn back before the top. Still, we had the chance to descend the iconic Davin Couloir from the Col des Prés les Fonts: 800 meters of vertical drop on a 40° slope, an aesthetic line clearly visible from the valley below.

It turned out to be the perfect occasion to revisit snowpack testing and refine decision-making in fresh snow conditions. A humbling, technical outing, the kind that sharpens your judgment, your edge… and your legs.
