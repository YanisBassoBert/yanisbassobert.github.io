Last year, we set ourselves the challenge of climbing as many 3000 m peaks in the Cerces range as possible. We ended the day completely exhausted, finishing in the dark with 3600 m of elevation gain in our legs  but it was an unforgettable experience. This year, we dreamed even bigger. The goal: link together several iconic summits in the Cerces: La Grande Tempête, Le Tabor, and La Pointe des Cerces. A 4000 d+ tour with Elliott, winding through one of our favorite massifs.

To prepare, I stacked up over 20 ski mountaineering outings this season, building on a solid endurance base from trail running. On February 4th, the conditions were perfect: stable snowpack, no wind, and just a light snowfall the day before. With the sun expected to shine hard, we aimed to reach the final summit before 2 PM, avoiding any avalanche risk, especially with fatigue setting in. Here is the description of this wonderfull day:
