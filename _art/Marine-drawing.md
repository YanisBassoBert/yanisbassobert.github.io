# 🐋 Whales

I’ve always been fascinated by marine life — especially whales. Their immense size, calm presence, and graceful movements feel almost surreal. They seem to glide effortlessly through the depths, embodying both power and serenity.  
Here are a few artworks I’ve created in tribute to these majestic creatures:

# 🌊 *Mystère Abyssal*

This drawing was inspired by the song *Mystère Abyssal* by MPL, which tells the tragic story of a diving accident.  
I tried to capture the chaos of the moment — the confusion, the agitation — and contrast it with the deep silence left behind by death.

# 🪸 Flying Manta Ray

Like whales, manta rays embody grace and calm. Their wide wings and slow, fluid movements feel almost like flight beneath the surface.  
This piece is a reflection on their peaceful presence in the ocean.
