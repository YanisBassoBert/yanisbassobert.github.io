# Le Short: Short movie club (2018)

With a group of friends, we created a short movie club called *Le Short*, with the goal of producing one short film each year. From scriptwriting and actor selection to video editing and composing original soundtracks, we take care of the entire creative process together.

*Here was my proposal for the logo:*

The logo represents two key stages of filmmaking: A typewriter symbolizes the pre-production phase, especially scriptwriting. A clapperboard illustrates the filming phase. A vibrant turquoise blue was chosen to give the project a strong and recognizable identity. The color also evokes calmness and introspection.

During exam season, I was unexpectedly contacted by Franck Debouck, then director of Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon:  
*"We need a logo for the Science 2024 consortium â€” there's a design contest, and we want ECL to participate."*  

After a brief hesitation, I jumped at the opportunity.

**Science 2024** was a consortium of 13 institutions, including top French Grandes Ã‰coles, military sports bodies, and national sports centers. Its mission: to conduct cutting-edge research to support and enhance athlete performance ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

We proudly finished **second** in the contest, just behind the submission from *Ã‰cole Polytechnique*.

*Here was my logo proposal:*

The logo features two intertwining branches forming the silhouette of the Eiffel Tower, a nod to the host city. The branches also resemble strands of DNA, representing scientific research and innovation. The Olympic rings sit at the top, symbolizing how science can elevate athletic performance.  

The color palette was intentionally aligned with that of Paris 2024, ensuring coherence and visual impact.
